Here is the current roadmap for libgdbmi. Plain and simple.
  [x] Implement the bison push parser that can parse gdb/mi
  [ ] Write automated unit tests to test this works.
  [ ] Implement a layer which turns the parse tree into a nice
      gdb/mi output command. This allows a client to easily access
      the fields they care about.
  [ ] Write automated unit tests to test this works.
  [ ] Document this API
  [ ] Integrate this API into CGDB.
