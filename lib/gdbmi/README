This package implements the gdbmi protocol. Currently, it simply parses an MI 
output command into a parse tree.

If you want to build this package, you need to have the auto tools installed. 
Once that is done, run ./autogen.sh to generate the ./configure script.
Alternativly, you can download CGDB, which has a version of this library with
the auto files already created.

Currently, this package depends on the push parser feature of bison which 
has not been released yet. If you need to build cgdb from source, grab 
bison from CVS. Hopefully the feature will be released soon.
